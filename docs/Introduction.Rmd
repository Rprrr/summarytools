# Overview

**summarytools** is a data exploration and reporting tool built around four core functions:

| Function | Description |
|:--------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <a href="#freq">`freq()`</a> | **frequency tables** with proportions, cumulative proportions and missing data information |
| <a href="#ctable">`ctable()`</a> | **cross-tabulations** between two factors or any discrete data, with total, rows or columns proportions, as well as marginal sums |
| <a href="#descr">`descr()`</a> | **descriptive (univariate) statistics** for numerical data |
| <a href="#dfsummary">`dfSummary()`</a> | Extensive **data frame summaries** that facilitate data cleaning and firsthand evaluation |

It was developed with the following objectives in mind:

  - Provide a coherent set of descriptive functions comparable to those
    offered in commercial statistical packages such as SAS, SPSS and Stata
  - Offer flexibility in terms of output formats and contents
  - Integrate well with [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and 
    [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) while also allowing stand-alone, 
    simple report generation

## Output Options

Results can be:

  - Displayed in the *R* console as plain text
  - Displayed in RStudio's Viewer or Web Browser
  - Written to files in plain text, *markdown* or *html*
  - Used in *Rmarkdown* documents inside
    [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr) code chunks

## Other Characteristics

  - Multilingual:
    + Built-in translations exist for French, Spanish, Russian and Turkish translations
    + Users can easily create additional translations if needed (and are encouraged to
      share them [online]("https://github.com/dcomtois/summarytools) so they can be added
      to the collection)
  - Pipe-Friendly:
    + The `%>%` and `%$%` operators from 
      the [magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=magrittr) package are supported
    + The `%>>%` operator from the [pipeR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pipeR)
      package is also supported
  - Configurable with global options, minimizing redundancy in function calls arguments

## This Vignette's Setup

Knowing how this vignette is configured should help users who wish to use **summarytools**
in *Rmarkdown* documents get started.

### The Setup Chunk

```
## ```{r setup, include=FALSE}
## library(knitr)
## opts_chunk$set(results = 'asis',      # This is essential (can also be set at the chunk-level)
##               comment = NA, 
##               prompt  = FALSE, 
##               cache   = FALSE)
## library(summarytools)
## st_options(plain.ascii = FALSE,      # Always use this option in Rmd documents
##           style       = "rmarkdown", # Always use this option in Rmd documents
##           footnote    = NA)          # Makes html-rendered results more concise
## ```
```

### Calling st_css()

This `st_css()` function adds *html* class definitions intended to
improve the layout of **summarytools** tables that are produced using *html* 
rendering. Not necessary if all tables are generated with "rmarkdown" style. 
More information on this function can be found in the 
[Recommendations for Using summarytools With Rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/summarytools/vignettes/Recommendations-rmarkdown.html)
vignette.

```
## ```{r, echo=FALSE}
## st_css()
## ```
```
<br/>

# <a id="freq"></a>Frequency Tables with freq()

The `freq()` function generates a frequency table with counts and
proportions.

```{r}
library(summarytools)
freq(iris$Species, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "rmarkdown")
```

In this first example, the `plain.ascii` and `style` arguments were
specified. However, since we have defined them globally with `st_options()`
in the setup chunk, they are redundant and will be omitted from hereon.

**To ignore missing data**, set `report.nas = FALSE`:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, headings = FALSE)
```

To simplify further, we can omit the *Totals* row and the
*cumulative* column:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, totals = FALSE, 
     cumul = FALSE, headings = FALSE)
```

## Generating Several Tables at Once

No `lapply()` needed here; just feed `freq()` with your data frame.
Numerical columns having more than 25 distinct values will be discarded.
It is possible to change this threshold value using `st_options()`.
(Results not shown.)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
freq(tobacco)
```

## Subsetting (Filtering) the Frequency Table

The `rows` argument allows subsetting the frequency table; we can
use it in 3 different ways:

  - To select rows by position, use a numerical vector; `rows = 1:10` will
    show the frequencies for the first 10 values only
  - To select rows by name, either use
    + a character vector specifying row names
    + a single character string to be used as a regular expression;
      only the matching column(s) will be displayed
    
To account for the frequencies of all unshown values, the "(Other)" row is
automatically generated.

In combination with the `order` argument, the subsetting feature can be
very practical. For a character variable containing a large number of 
distinct values, showing only the most frequent can be achieved easily:

```{r}
freq(tobacco$disease, order = "freq", rows = 1:5)
```

**Note**: the *tobacco* data frame contains simulated data and is included in
the package.

<br/>

# <a id="ctable"></a>Cross-Tabulations with ctable

`ctable()` generates cross-tabulations, or joint frequencies, for two
categorical variables. 

Unfortunately, *markdown* does not support multiline table headings.
It does however handle *html* code, so we'll use *html* rendering
for this section.

Using the sample *tobacco* data frame, we'll cross-tabulate the
categorical variables *smoker* and *diseased*.


```{r}
print(ctable(x = tobacco$smoker, y = tobacco$diseased, prop = "r"),
      method = "render")
```

**Row proportions are shown by default**. To display column or total
proportions, use `prop = "c"` or `prop = "t"`, respectively. To omit
proportions altogether, use `prop = "n"`.

Here is a bare “2 x 2” table:

```{r}
with(tobacco, 
     print(ctable(x = smoker, y = diseased, prop = 'n', 
                  totals = FALSE, headings = FALSE),
           method = "render"))
```

### Chi-Square ($\chi$^2^) Statistic

To display the chi-square statistic, set `chisq = TRUE`. To show how
pipes can be used with **summarytools**, we'll make use of the
**magrittr** package:

```{r}
library(magrittr)
tobacco %$% 
  ctable(gender, smoker, chisq = TRUE, headings = FALSE) %>%
  print(method = "render")
```

<br/>

# <a id="descr"></a>Descriptive Statistics with descr()

`descr()` generates descriptive / univariate statistics: common central
tendency statistics and measures of dispersion. It can handle single
vectors as well as data frames, in which case all non-numerical columns
are discarded, with a message to that effect.

```{r}
descr(iris)
```

## Transposing, Selecting Statistics

The results can be transposed by using `transpose = TRUE`. Desired statistics
can also be specified using the `stats` argument:

```{r}
descr(iris, stats = c("mean", "sd"), transpose = TRUE, headings = FALSE)
```

See `?descr` for the list of all available statistics. Special values 
“all”, “fivenum”, and “common” are also valid for the `stats` argument.
The default value is “all”.

<br/>

# <a id="dfsummary"></a>Data Frame Summaries with dfSummary() 

`dfSummary()` creates a summary table with statistics, frequencies and graphs
for all the variables contained in a data frame. The information displayed is
type-specific (character, factor, numeric, date) and also factor in other
attributes such as the number of distinct values. 

Other notable features for this function:

 - Reports number of duplicate records in the heading section 
 - Detects UPC/EAN codes (barcode numbers) 
 - Detects variables containing email addresses and produces counts
   for valid, invalid and duplicate entries
 
To see the results in RStudio's Viewer (or in the default Web browser if
working outside RStudio), use the `view()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(summarytools)
view(dfSummary(iris))
```
<img src="dfSummary_in_RStudio_Viewer.png" width=100% style="border:0" />

When using `dfSummary()` in *Rmarkdown* documents, it is generally a good 
idea to exclude a column or two to avoid margin overflow. Since the *Valid*
and *NA* columns are redundant, we can drop either one of them; the variable
number is another column that is often not essential.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dfSummary(tobacco, style = "grid", graph.magnif = 0.75, 
          valid.col = FALSE, tmp.img.dir = "/tmp")
```
<img src="dfSummary_md.png" width=100%/>

The `tmp.img.dir` parameter is mandatory when generating *dfSummaries* using
"rmarkdown", "multiline", or "grid" styles. The explanation for this can be
found [further below](#tmp-img-dir). This parameter can only be ignored when
using the *html* rendering method.

<br/>

# Grouped Statistics with stby()

To produce optimal results, **summarytools** has its own "tweaked" version of
the base `by()` function. It's called `stby()`, and we use it exactly as we
would `by()`:

```{r}
(iris_stats_by_species <- stby(data = iris, 
                               INDICES = iris$Species, 
                               FUN = descr, stats = c("common"), transpose = TRUE))
```

### Special Case of descr() with stby()

When using `descr()` to produce grouped statistics for a single variable, the
series of one-column tables is assembled into one:

```{r}
with(tobacco, stby(data = BMI, INDICES = age.gr, 
                   FUN = descr, stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
```

### Using stby() with ctable()

The syntax is a little trickier, so here is an example (results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
stby(list(x = tobacco$smoker, y = tobacco$diseased), tobacco$gender, ctable)
# or equivalently
with(tobacco, stby(list(x = smoker, y = diseased), gender, ctable))
```

<br/>

# Grouped Statistics with dplyr::group_by()

To create grouped statistics with `freq()`, `descr()` or `dfSummary()`, it is
possible to use **dplyr**'s `group_by()` as an alternative to `stby()`. Syntactic
differences aside, the one key distinction is that `dplyr::group_by()` considers
`NA` values on the grouping variables as valid category, albeit with a warning
message suggesting the use of `forcats::fct_explicit_na` to make `NA`'s explicit
in factors. Following the latter advice, we get:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
tobacco$gender <- forcats::fct_explicit_na(tobacco$gender)
tobacco %>% group_by(gender) %>% descr(stats = "fivenum")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
tobacco$gender <- forcats::fct_explicit_na(tobacco$gender)
tobacco %>% group_by(gender) %>% descr(stats = "fivenum")
```

<br/>

# Tidy Tables With tb()

When generating `freq()` or `descr()` tables, it is possible to turn the
results into "tidy" tables with the use of the `tb()` function (think of
*tb* as a diminutive for *tibble*). For example:

```{r, results='markup'}
library(magrittr)
iris %>% descr(stats = "common") %>% tb()
iris$Species %>% freq(cumul = FALSE, report.nas = FALSE) %>% tb()
```

By definition, no total rows are part of *tidy* tables, and row names are
converted to regular columns. Note that for these results, the **knitr**
chunk option 'results' is set to "markup".

## Tidy Split-Group Statistics

Here are two examples of how lists created using `stby()` are
transformed into *tibbles*. Notice how the *order* parameter affects the
row ordering:

```{r, results='markup'}
grouped_freqs <- stby(data = tobacco$smoker, INDICES = tobacco$gender,
                      FUN = freq, cumul = FALSE, report.nas = FALSE)
grouped_freqs %>% tb()
grouped_freqs %>% tb(order = 2)

grouped_descr <- stby(data = exams, INDICES = exams$gender, 
                      FUN = descr, stats = "common")
grouped_descr %>% tb()
grouped_descr %>% tb(order = 2)
```

<br/>

# Writing Output to Files

Using the `file` argument with `print()` or `view()`, we can redirect outputs
to a file, be it *html*, *Rmd*, *md*, or just plain text (*txt*). The file
extension indicates what type of content should be generated.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species, file = "~/iris_stats_by_species.html")
```

## Appending Output Files

The `append` argument allows adding content to existing files generated by
**summarytools**. This is useful if you want to include several statistical
tables in a single file. It is a quick alternative to creating a *.Rmd* document.

## Generating PDF's

There is no direct way to create a *PDF* file with **summarytools**. One option is
to generate an *html* file and convert it to *PDF* using a tool like
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) or [WK<html>TOpdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/index.html)
(the latter gives better results than Pandoc with `dfSummary()` outputs).

Another option is to create a *.Rmd* document with *PDF* output format.

<br/>

# Global options

                                  # the present document.
```

# Overriding Formatting Attributes

When a **summarytools** object is created, its formatting attributes are
stored within it. However, you can override most of them when using the
`print()` method or the `view()` function.

## Overriding Function-Specific Arguments

| caption        |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |


## Overriding Headings Content

| Argument           | freq   | ctable | descr | dfSummary |
| -----------------: | :----: | :----: | :---: | :-------: |
| Data.frame         |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |

| Row.variable       |        |   x    |       |           |
| Col.variable       |        |   x    |       |           |


**Example**

In the following example, we will override 3 function-specific arguments
and one heading attribute:

```{r}
(age_stats <- freq(tobacco$age.gr)) 
print(age_stats, report.nas = FALSE, totals = FALSE, display.type = FALSE,
      Variable.label = "Age Group")
```


## Order of Priority for Parameters / Options

1.  `print()` or `view()` parameters have precedence
2.  `freq() / ctable() / descr() / dfSummary()` parameters come second
3.  Global options set with `st_options()` come third

<br/>

# Fine-Tuning Looks with CSS

For *html* rendering, **summarytools** uses
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)'s cascading stylesheets along with
a limited set of classes defined in the two following *.css* files:

 - includes/stylesheets/summarytools.css"
 - includes/stylesheets/summarytools-global.css"

The class definitions from *summarytools.css* are included by default whenever
*html* rendering is done (either with `view()` or with `print()` .................)


While retaining or not the default **Bootstrap** CSS styling, 
it is possible to use a custom *CSS* file with additional class
definitions. 

**Example**
We need to use a very small font size for a simple *html*
report containing a `dfSummary()`. For this, we create a
*.css* file (with the name of our choosing) which contains
the following class definition:

```css
.tiny-text {
  font-size: 8px;
}
```

The last step is to produce the *html* file using `print()` with
the following arguments (results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(tobacco), custom.css = 'path/to/custom.css', 
      table.classes = 'tiny-text', file = "tiny-tobacco-dfSummary.html")
```

**There is a predefined class called `st-small`** which uses a 13px font-size
of 

<br/>

# Creating *Shiny* apps

To successfully include **summarytools** functions in *Shiny* apps,

 - use *html* rendering
 - set `bootstrap.css = FALSE` to avoid interacting with the app's layout  
 - set `headings = FALSE` in case problems arise (which is more likely than not)
 - adjust graphs with the `graph.magnif` parameter or the `dfSummary.graph.magnif` global option
 - if `dfSummary()` outputs are too wide, omit a column or two (`valid.col` and `varnumbers`,
   for instance)
 - if needed, set the column widths manually with the `col.widths` parameter in the 
   `print()` method or the `view()` function


```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(somedata, graph.magnif = 0.8), 
      method = 'render',
      headings = FALSE,
      bootstrap.css = FALSE)
```

## Graphs in Markdown dfSummaries {#tmp-img-dir}

When using `dfSummary()` in a *.Rmd* document without using *html*
rendering, three elements are needed to display proper *png* graphs:

  1 - `plain.ascii` is set to FALSE  
  2 - `style` is set to "grid"  
  3 - `tmp.img.dir` is defined  

Why the third element? Although *R* makes it really easy to 
create temporary files and directories, they do have long pathnames,
especially on Windows. Unfortunately, Pandoc determines the final
(rendered) column widths by counting characters in a cell, 
even if those characters are paths pointing to images.

At this time, there seems to be only one solution around this problem:
cut down on characters in image paths. So instead of this:
```
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Variable  | Graph                                                                   | Valid   |
+===========+=========================================================================+=========+
| gender\   | ![](C:/Users/johnny/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpYRgetx/file5aa4549a4d71.png) | 978\    |
| [factor]  |                                                                         | (97.8%) |
+----+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
```

...we aim for this:
```
+---------------+----------------------+---------+
| Variable      | Graph                | Valid   |
+===============+======================+=========+
| gender\       | ![](/tmp/ds0001.png) | 978\    |
| [factor]      |                      | (97.8%) |
+---------------+----------------------+---------+
```

Now CRAN policies are really strict when it comes to writing content in 
the user directories, or anywhere outside *R's temporary zone* (for good 
reasons). So we need to let the users set this location themselves,
therefore implicitly consenting to having content written outside 
the predefined temporary zone.

On Mac OS and Linux, using "/tmp" makes a lot of sense: it's a short path,
and it's self-cleaning. On Windows, there is no such convenient directory, so
we need to pick one -- be it absolute ("/tmp") or relative ("img",
or simply "."). Two things are to be kept in mind: it needs to be short
(5 characters max) and we need to clean it up manually.

# Translations

It is now possible to change the language used in the outputs. The following
languages are available, thanks to the R community's involvement:
French (*fr*), Portuguese (*pt*), Russian (*ru*), Spanish (*es*), and
Turkish (*tr*).

## Switching Languages

To switch languages, simply use 

```{r}
st_options(lang = "fr")
```

Any function will now produce outputs using that language:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species)
```

The language used for producing the object is stored within it as an attribute.
This is to avoid problems when switching languages between the moment the 
object is stored, and the moment at which it is printed.

## Non-UTF-8 Locales

On most Windows systems, it will be necessary to change the `LC_CTYPE` element
of the locale settings if the character set is not included in the current
locale. For instance, in order to get good results -- or rather, any results at
all -- with the Russian language in a "latin1" environment, we'll need to do
this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE", "russian")
st_options(lang = 'ru')
```

Then, to go back to default settings:

```{r, results='hide'}
Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE", "")
st_options(lang = "en")
```

## Defining and Using Custom Translations

Using the function `use_custom_lang()`, it is possible to add your own set of 
translations. To achieve this, get the 
[csv template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcomtois/summarytools/master/translations/language_template.csv),
customize the +/- 70 items, and call `use_custom_lang()`, giving it as
sole argument the path to your edited *csv* file. Note that such
custom translations will not persist across R sessions. This means that
you should always have this *csv* file handy for future use.

## Defining Specific Keywords

Sometimes, all you might want to do is change just a few keywords -- say you
would rather have "N" instead of "Freq" in the title row of `freq()` tables. No
need to create a full custom language for that. Rather, use `define_keywords()`.
Calling this function without any arguments will bring up, on systems that
support graphical devices (the vast majority, that is), an editable window
allowing the modify only the desired items. 

<img src="define_keywords.png" width=95% style="border:1;border-color:grey" />

After closing the edit window, you will be able to export the resulting
"custom language" into a *csv* file that you can reuse in the future by 
calling `use_custom_lang()`.

It is also possible to programmatically define one or several
keywords using `define_keywords()`. For instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
define_keywords(freq = "N")
```

See `?define_keywords` for more details.
