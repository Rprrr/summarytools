# 1. Overview

**summarytools** is a an [*R*](https://www.r-project.org) package for data exploration and simple reporting. 

**Four functions** are at its core:

| Function | Description |
|---------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <a href="#freq">`freq()`</a> | **Frequency Tables** featuring counts, proportions, as well as missing data information |
| <a href="#ctable">`ctable()`</a> | **Cross-Tabulations** (joint frequencies) between pairs of discrete variables featuring marginal sums as well as row, column or total proportions |
| <a href="#descr">`descr()`</a> | **Descriptive (Univariate) Statistics** for numerical data featuring common measures of central tendency and dispersion |
| <a href="#dfsummary">`dfSummary()`</a> | Extensive **Data Frame Summaries** featuring type-specific information for all variables in a data frame: univariate statistics and/or frequency distributions, bar charts or histograms, as well as missing data counts. Very useful to quickly detect anomalies and identify trends at a glance |

It was developed with the following objectives in mind:

  - Provide a coherent set of easy to use descriptive functions that are
    comparable to those offered by commercial statistical packages such
    as SAS, SPSS and Stata  
  - Offer flexibility in terms of output formats and contents  
  - Integrate well with commonly used packages and technologies used 
    for reporting ([the RStudio IDE](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/),
    [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/))
    while also allowing for stand-alone, simple report generation  

## 1.1 Output Options

Results can be

  - Displayed in the *R* console as plain text  
  - Rendered as *html* and shown in RStudio's Viewer or in a Web Browser  
  - Written to / appended to plain text, *markdown*, or *html* files with
    the `print()` and `view()` functions  
  - Used in *Rmarkdown* reports  

## 1.2 Other Characteristics

 - Pipe-Friendly:  
    + The `%>%` and `%$%` operators from 
     the [magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=magrittr) package are supported  
    + The `%>>%` operator from the [pipeR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pipeR)
     package is also supported  
 - Multilingual:  
   + Built-in translations exist for French, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Turkish  
    + Users can easily add custom translations or modify existing sets of
     translations as needed  
  - Customizable: default values for most function arguments can be modified,
   thus simplifying coding and minimizing redundancy  

## 1.3 Installing summarytools

### Required Software

Additional software is used by **summarytools** to fine-tune
graphics as well as offer interactive features. If installing
**summarytools** for the first time, click on the link corresponding
to your Operating System to get detailed instructions. Note that
on Windows, no additional software is required.

<a href="#required-mac-os">Mac OS X</a>  
<a href="#required-debian">Ubuntu / Debian / Mint</a>  
<a href="#required--older-ubuntu">Older Ubuntu (14 and 16)</a>  
<a href="#required-fedora">Fedora / Red Hat / CentOS</a>  
<a href="#required-solaris">Solaris</a>  

### Installing From GitHub

This is the recommended method, as some minor fixes and improvements
are regularly added.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes") # Using devtools is also possible
library(remotes)
install_github("rapporter/pander") # Necessary for optimal results!
install_github("dcomtois/summarytools")
```

### Installing From CRAN

CRAN versions are stable but are not updated as often as the GitHub versions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("summarytools")
```

# 2. The Core Functions

## <a id="freq"></a>2.1 Frequency Tables with freq()

The `freq()` function generates frequency tables with counts,
proportions, as well as missing data information. It is similar
to SAS's `FREQ` procedure and SPSS's `FREQUENCIES` command.

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "rmarkdown")
```

In this first example, the `plain.ascii` and `style` arguments were
specified. However, since we have defined them globally with `st_options()`
in the setup chunk, they are redundant and will be omitted from hereon.

### 2.1.1 Ignoring Missing Values

The `report.nas` function argument can be set to `FALSE` in order to
ignore missing values (*NA*'s). Doing so has the following
effects on the results table:

 1. The `<NA>` row no longer appears  
 2. The `% Total` and `% Total Cum.` columns no longer appear  
 3. The `% Valid` column simply becomes `%`  
 4. The `% Valid Cum.` column simply becomes `% Cum.`  

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, headings = FALSE)
```

Note that the `headings = FALSE` parameter suppresses the heading section.

### 2.1.2 Frequency Tables at Their Simplest Expression

By "switching off" all optional elements, the following table is produced:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, totals = FALSE, 
     cumul = FALSE, headings = FALSE)
```

## 2.1.3 Generating Several Frequency Tables at Once

Instead of using `lapply()`, it is perfectly okay to use
`freq()` on a whole data frame (results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
freq(tobacco)
```

To avoid cluttering the results, numerical columns having more
than 25 distinct values will be discarded (note that this threshold of 
25 can be changed by using `st_options()`; see `?st_options` for details).

(**Note**: the *tobacco* data frame contains simulated data and is part of
the package.)

## 2.1.4 Subsetting (Filtering) Frequency Tables

The `rows` parameter allows subsetting frequency tables; we can
use this parameter it in 3 distinct ways:

  - To filter rows by their order of appearance, we use a numerical vector;
    `rows = 1:10` will only show the frequencies for the first 10 values  
  - To filter rows by their names, we either use  
    + a character vector specifying the exact row names
      we wish to keep in the results  
    + a single character string which will be used as a
      regular expression to select the matching column(s);
      see `?regex` for more information on regular expressions  
    
To account for the frequencies of all unshown values, the "(Other)" row is
automatically added.

Used in combination with the `order` argument, this subsetting feature
can be quite practical. For a character variable containing a large number
of distinct values, showing only the most frequent can be achieved easily:

```{r}
freq(tobacco$disease, order = "freq", rows = 1:5)
```

## 2.1.5 Collapsible Sections

When generating *html* results, use the `collapse = TRUE` argument with
`print()` or `view()` to get collapsible sections; clicking on the variable
name heading will collapse the frequency table for that variable (results
not shown).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(freq(tobacco), collapse = TRUE)
```

## <a id="ctable"></a>2.2 Cross-Tabulations with ctable()

`ctable()` generates cross-tabulations (joint frequencies) for
pairs of categorical variables. 

Since *markdown* does not support multiline table headings
(but does accept *html* code), we'll use **summarytools**' *html*
rendering feature for this section.

Using the *tobacco* data frame, we'll cross-tabulate two
of its categorical variables: *smoker* and *diseased*.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
print(ctable(x = tobacco$smoker, y = tobacco$diseased, prop = "r"),
      method = "render")
```
<img src="img/ctable-with-row-props.png" style="border:0"/>

### 2.2.1 Choosing Which Proportions To Show

Row proportions are shown by default. To display column or total
proportions, use `prop = "c"` or `prop = "t"`, respectively. To omit
proportions altogether, use `prop = "n"`.

### 2.2.2 Cross-Tabulations at Their Simplest Expression

By "switching off" all optional features, we get a simple “2 x 2” table:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
with(tobacco, 
     print(ctable(x = smoker, y = diseased, prop = 'n',
                  totals = FALSE, headings = FALSE),
           method = "render"))
```
<img src="img/ctable-barebones-2.png" style="border:0"/>

### 2.2.3 Chi-Square (&#120536;<sup>2</sup>) Statistic

To display the chi-square statistic, set `chisq = TRUE`. To show how
pipes can be used with **summarytools**, we'll use **magrittr**'s
`%$%` and `%>%` operators:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
tobacco %$%  # The %$% operator replaces the with() function
  ctable(gender, smoker, chisq = TRUE, headings = FALSE) %>%
  print(method = "render")
```
<img src="img/ctable-chisq.png" style="border:0"  width=500px/>


## <a id="descr"></a>2.3 Descriptive Statistics with descr()

`descr()` generates descriptive / univariate statistics: common central
tendency statistics and measures of dispersion. It can handle single
vectors as well as data frames, in which case all non-numerical columns
are discarded, with a message to that effect.

```{r}
descr(iris)
```

### 2.3.1 Transposing and Selecting Statistics

Results can be transposed by using `transpose = TRUE`. Statistics
can also be selected using the `stats` argument:

```{r}
descr(iris, stats = c("mean", "sd"), transpose = TRUE, headings = FALSE)
```

See `?descr` for a list of all available statistics. Special values 
“all”, “fivenum”, and “common” are also valid for the `stats` argument.
The default value is “all”.


## <a id="dfsummary"></a>2.4 Data Frame Summaries with dfSummary() 

`dfSummary()` creates a summary table with statistics, frequencies and graphs
for all the variables contained in a data frame. The information displayed is
type-specific (character, factor, numeric, date) and also varies according to
the number of distinct values.

### 2.4.1 Special Properties of dfSummary()

This function

 - Reports the number of duplicate records in the heading section  
 - Detects UPC/EAN codes (barcode numbers) and doesn't calculate irrelevant
   statistics for them  
 - Detects email addresses and reports counts of valid,
   invalid and duplicate entries  
 
To see the results in RStudio's Viewer (or in the default Web browser if
working in another IDE or from a terminal window), we use the `view()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(dfSummary(iris))
```
![dfSummary Output displayed in RStudio's viewer](img/dfSummary_in_RStudio_Viewer.png)

### 2.4.2 Using dfSummary() in Rmarkdown Documents

When using `dfSummary()` in *Rmarkdown* documents, it is generally a good 
idea to exclude a column or two to avoid margin overflow. Since the *Valid*
and *NA* columns are redundant, we can generally drop either one of them.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dfSummary(tobacco, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "grid", 
          graph.magnif = 0.75, valid.col = FALSE, tmp.img.dir = "/tmp")
```

![dfSummary-rendered-markdown](img/dfSummary-render-in-markdown.png)

**The `tmp.img.dir` parameter** is mandatory when generating *dfSummaries* in
*Rmarkdown* documents (which requires using either "multiline" or "grid" as styles.
The explanation for this can be found [further below](#tmp-img-dir). This parameter
can be ignored in every other circumstance.

# 3. Grouped Statistics Using stby()

To produce optimal results, **summarytools** has its own version of
the base `by()` function. It's called `stby()`, and we use it exactly as we
would `by()`:

```{r}
(iris_stats_by_species <- stby(data = iris, 
                               INDICES = iris$Species, 
                               FUN = descr, stats = "common", transpose = TRUE))
```

## 3.1 Special Case of descr() with stby()

When used to produce split-group statistics for a single variable, `descr()`
creates a single table instead of a series of one-column tables.

```{r}
with(tobacco, stby(data = BMI, INDICES = age.gr, 
                   FUN = descr, stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
```

## 3.2 Using stby() with ctable()

The syntax is a little trickier, so here is an example (results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
stby(list(x = tobacco$smoker, y = tobacco$diseased), tobacco$gender, ctable)
# or equivalently
with(tobacco, stby(list(x = smoker, y = diseased), gender, ctable))
```

# 4. Grouped Statistics Using dplyr::group_by()

To create grouped statistics with `freq()`, `descr()` or `dfSummary()`, it is
possible to use **dplyr**'s `group_by()` as an alternative to `stby()`. Syntactic
differences aside, the one key distinction is that `dplyr::group_by()` considers
`NA` values on the grouping variables as a valid group, albeit with a warning
message suggesting the use of `forcats::fct_explicit_na` to make `NA`'s explicit
in factors. Following the latter advice, we get:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
tobacco$gender %<>% forcats::fct_explicit_na()
tobacco %>% group_by(gender) %>% descr(stats = "fivenum")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(magrittr)
tobacco$gender %<>% forcats::fct_explicit_na()
tobacco %>% group_by(gender) %>% descr(stats = "fivenum")
```

# 5. Creating Tidy Tables Using tb()

When generating `freq()` or `descr()` tables, it is possible to turn the
results into "tidy" tables with the use of the `tb()` function (think of
*tb* as a diminutive for *tibble*). For example:

```{r, results='markup'}
library(magrittr)
iris %>% descr(stats = "common") %>% tb()
iris$Species %>% freq(cumul = FALSE, report.nas = FALSE) %>% tb()
```

By definition, no total rows are part of *tidy* tables, and the row
names stored in a regular columns. Note that for displaying
*tibbles* using *Rmarkdown*, the **knitr** chunk option 'results'
must is set to "markup" and not "asis".

## 5.1 Tidy Split-Group Statistics

Here are two examples of how lists created using `stby()` are
transformed into *tibbles*. Notice how the *order* parameter affects the
table's row ordering:

```{r, results='markup'}
grouped_freqs <- stby(data = tobacco$smoker,
                      INDICES = tobacco$gender,
                      FUN = freq, cumul = FALSE, report.nas = FALSE)
grouped_freqs %>% tb()
grouped_freqs %>% tb(order = 2)

grouped_descr <- stby(data = exams, INDICES = exams$gender, 
                      FUN = descr, stats = "common")
grouped_descr %>% tb()
grouped_descr %>% tb(order = 2)
```

# 6. Writing Output to Files

Using the `file` argument with `print()` or `view()`, we can redirect outputs
to a file, be it *html*, *Rmd*, *md*, or just plain text (*txt*). The file
extension indicates what type of content should be generated.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species, file = "~/iris_stats_by_species.html")
```

## 6.1 Appending Output Files

The `append` argument allows adding content to existing files generated by
**summarytools**. This is useful if you want to include several statistical
tables in a single file. It is a quick alternative to creating an *Rmd* document.

## 6.2 Generating *PDF*'s

There is no direct way to create a *PDF* file with **summarytools**. One option is
to generate an *html* file and convert it to *PDF* using a tool like
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) or [WK\<html\>TOpdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/index.html)
(the latter gives better results than Pandoc with `dfSummary()` outputs).

Another option is to create an *Rmd* document with *PDF* output format.

# 7. Global options

The following options can be set with `st_options()`:

                                  # the present document.
```

# 8. Overriding Formatting Attributes

When a **summarytools** object is created, its formatting attributes are
stored within it. However, you can override most of them when using the
`print()` method or the `view()` function.

| Col.variable       |        |   x    |       |           |


### Example

In the following example, we will override 3 function-specific arguments
and one heading attribute:

```{r}
(age_stats <- freq(tobacco$age.gr)) 
print(age_stats, report.nas = FALSE, totals = FALSE, display.type = FALSE,
      Variable.label = "Age Group")
```

## 8.3 Order of Priority for Parameters / Options

1.  `print()` or `view()` parameters have precedence
2.  `freq() / ctable() / descr() / dfSummary()` parameters come second
3.  Global options set with `st_options()` come third

# 9. Fine-Tuning Looks with CSS

For *html* rendering, **summarytools** uses
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)'s cascading stylesheets along with
a limited set of classes defined in the two following *.css* files:

 - includes/stylesheets/summarytools.css"
 - includes/stylesheets/summarytools-global.css"

The class definitions from *summarytools.css* are included by default whenever
*html* rendering is done (either with `view()` or `print()`).

While retaining or not the default **Bootstrap** CSS styling, 
it is possible to use a custom *CSS* file with additional class
definitions. 

### Example

We need to use a very small font size for a simple *html*
report containing a `dfSummary()`. For this, we create a
*.css* file (with the name of our choosing) which contains
the following class definition:

```css
.tiny-text {
  font-size: 8px;
}
```

The last step is to produce the *html* file using `print()` with
the following arguments (results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(tobacco), custom.css = 'path/to/custom.css', 
      table.classes = 'tiny-text', file = "tiny-tobacco-dfSummary.html")
```


# 10. Creating *Shiny* apps

To successfully include **summarytools** functions in *Shiny* apps,

 - use *html* rendering
 - set `bootstrap.css = FALSE` to avoid interacting with the app's layout  
 - set `headings = FALSE` in case problems arise (which is more likely than not)
 - adjust graphs with the `graph.magnif` parameter or the `dfSummary.graph.magnif` global option
 - if `dfSummary()` outputs are too wide, omit a column or two (`valid.col` and `varnumbers`,
   for instance)
 - if needed, set the column widths manually with the `col.widths` parameter in the 
   `print()` method or the `view()` function


```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(somedata, graph.magnif = 0.8), 
      method = 'render',
      headings = FALSE,
      bootstrap.css = FALSE)
```

# 11. Graphs in Markdown dfSummaries {#tmp-img-dir}

When using `dfSummary()` in a *.Rmd* document without using *html*
rendering, three elements are needed to display proper *png* graphs:

  1 - `plain.ascii` is set to FALSE  
  2 - `style` is set to "grid"  
  3 - `tmp.img.dir` is defined  

Why the third element? Although *R* makes it really easy to 
create temporary files and directories, they do have long pathnames,
especially on Windows. Unfortunately, Pandoc determines the final
(rendered) column widths by counting characters in a cell, 
even if those characters are paths pointing to images.

At this time, there seems to be only one solution around this problem:
cut down on characters in image paths. So instead of this:
```
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Variable  | Graph                                                                   | Valid   |
+===========+=========================================================================+=========+
| gender\   | ![](C:/Users/johnny/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpYRgetx/file5aa4549a4d71.png) | 978\    |
| [factor]  |                                                                         | (97.8%) |
+----+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
```

...we aim for this:
```
+---------------+----------------------+---------+
| Variable      | Graph                | Valid   |
+===============+======================+=========+
| gender\       | ![](/tmp/ds0001.png) | 978\    |
| [factor]      |                      | (97.8%) |
+---------------+----------------------+---------+
```

Now CRAN policies are really strict when it comes to writing content in 
the user directories, or anywhere outside *R's temporary zone* (for good 
reasons). So we need to let the users set this location themselves,
therefore implicitly consenting to having content written outside 
the predefined temporary zone.

On Mac OS and Linux, using "/tmp" makes a lot of sense: it's a short path,
and it's self-cleaning. On Windows, there is no such convenient directory, so
we need to pick one -- be it absolute ("/tmp") or relative ("img",
or simply "."). Two things are to be kept in mind: it needs to be short
(5 characters max) and we need to clean it up manually.

# 12. Translations

It is now possible to change the language used in the outputs. The following
languages are available, thanks to the R community's efforts:
French (*fr*), Portuguese (*pt*), Russian (*ru*), Spanish (*es*), and
Turkish (*tr*).

## 12.1 Switching Languages

To switch languages, simply use 

```{r}
st_options(lang = "fr")
```

Any function will now produce outputs using that language:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species)
```

The language used for producing the object is stored within it as an attribute.
This is to avoid problems when switching languages between the moment the 
object is stored, and the moment at which it is printed.

## 12.2 Non-UTF-8 Locales

On most Windows systems, it will be necessary to change the `LC_CTYPE` element
of the locale settings if the character set is not included in the current
locale. For instance, in order to get good results -- or rather, any results at
all -- with the Russian language in a "latin1" environment, we'll need to do
this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE", "russian")
st_options(lang = 'ru')
```

Then, to go back to default settings:

```{r, results='hide'}
Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE", "")
st_options(lang = "en")
```

## 12.3 Defining and Using Custom Translations

Using the function `use_custom_lang()`, it is possible to add your own set of 
translations. To achieve this, get the 
[csv template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcomtois/summarytools/master/translations/language_template.csv),
customize the +/- 70 items, and call `use_custom_lang()`, giving it as
sole argument the path to your edited *csv* file. Note that such
custom translations will not persist across R sessions. This means that
you should always have this *csv* file handy for future use.

## 12.4 Defining Specific Keywords

Sometimes, all you might want to do is change just a few keywords -- say you
would rather have "N" instead of "Freq" in the title row of `freq()` tables. No
need to create a full custom language for that. Rather, use `define_keywords()`.
Calling this function without any arguments will bring up, on systems that
support graphical devices (the vast majority, that is), an editable window
allowing the modify only the desired items. 

<img src="img/define_keywords.png" width=95% style="border:1;border-color:grey" />

After closing the edit window, you will be able to export the resulting
"custom language" into a *csv* file that you can reuse in the future by 
calling `use_custom_lang()`.

It is also possible to programmatically define one or several
keywords using `define_keywords()`. For instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
define_keywords(freq = "N")
```

See `?define_keywords` for more details.
